# Feature Request


## Where can I request some features I want added to the systems?
The only way to request a feature is to join our Discord Server and use the appropriate channel.

If you want to propose a feature, it has to be useful for other servers as well and not only benefit you. 
We will review your request and decide if its useful or not.
