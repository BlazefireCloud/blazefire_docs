# System Features

## Auto / manual database sync
You find it annoying to add your citizens and vehicles manually? We have created a special feature that will do the work for you and automatically synchronize your citizens and vehicles with our database. 

## API Access

::: warning Requires subscription
In order to use the api you'll need a subscription. Check [it](https://blazefire.io) out.
:::

You can use our API to update, delete or add new data. You are in control of your data, at any time.

## File Uploads
With our systems you have the possibility to upload different files in different sections. 
e.g. You are creating an investigation and have pictures from the crime scene? No problem, just upload them. All people who have access to the investigation can view and download them. But you can also upload pictures of citizens, for example when they were arrested for the first time.

## European Servers
We care about performance and safety. Thus, we host our servers in Europe to provide the highest possible performance and security.

## Partial page reloads
Constantly reloading a page is pretty annoying isn't it? We have a method for this as well, whereby only certain parts of the page are updated and an entire page reload is no longer necessary. 

## Database support
At the moment our database sync supports only MySQL databases. If you use another database type, you can insert your data via our API.

## Highly Customizable
To customize your system to your own server, we offer you options such as changing the logo of the system, or even the background.
